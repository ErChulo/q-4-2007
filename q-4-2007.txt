#1: Title

This is Question #4 from the 2007 EA basic exam. 
This one belongs to the [->] life contingencies topic

[->]

#2: Question sheet + Key items

	Here you may read the question, so lets take a few minutes to do the calculations...

        (Wait for people to do exercise)

	(upon resuming...)	
		
        [->] So...

#2.5 (button appears)

	The most important things to extract after reading the question are these items...

	[->]

	the 1/1/2007 origin of time and the "commencing on 1/1/2007" so that we are talking about an annuity due

	age 60 is critical to the calculation

	and the lives curve, which one should immediately recognize as a D'Moivre.

	Notice carefully that the domain gives the terminal age parameter for the calculations.

	[close][->] 

#3: Cashflows diagrams for Y & Z

	For annuity #1 we have level payments of 1000 at the begining of each year while alive.

	The present value, thus, would be the sum of these terms, times 1000.

	So, this would be the expression for the factor in this mortality model.

	(wait the next annuity title)

	For annuity #2 we get the expected payment by calculating this expression times 15000.

	This is a pure endowment and this is its formal symbol.

	So, this would be the expression for the factor in this mortality model.

	[->] 

#4: Brief Explanation of D'Moivre model

	Lets quickly review the basic functions for this model.

	[->]

	D'Moivre is defined by a Uniform Distribution on a finite interval.

	So this is the form for such densities.
	
	[->]

	By integration of the density, we get its (Cumulative) distribution function, shown here.

	[->]

	 The survival function is given by subtracting F from 1...

	[->]

	And finally, the force of mortality, is minus the derivative of S divided by S.

	These relations are important to remember not just for this model.

	From these functions, the tPx and tqx's follow immediately.

	[->]

	NOTE: it is easier to derive the annuity due in this model by 1 plus the annuity immediate, than calculating it directly.
